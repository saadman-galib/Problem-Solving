# Problem

Somu went to the gym today. He decided to do XX sets of squats. Each set consists of 1515 squats. Determine the total number of squats that he did today.

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer TT — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer XX — the total number of sets of squats that Somu did.

## Output Format

For each test case, output the total number of squats done by Somu.

### Constraints

1≤T≤1000

1≤X≤10^5

### Sample 1:

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Input Samples</th>
    <th>Output Samples</th>
</tr>
<tr></tr>

<tr>
    <td>3<br />1<br />4<br />99</td>
    <td>15<br />60<br />1485<br /><br /></td>
</tr>
</table>

### Explanation:

#### Test Case 1: Since, he does only 11 set of squats, the total number of squats done by him is 1515.

#### Test Case 2: Since, he does 44 sets of squats, the total number of squats is 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 = 6015+15+15+15=60.
