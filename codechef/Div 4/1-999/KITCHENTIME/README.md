The working hours of Chef’s kitchen are from XX pm to YY pm (1≤X<Y≤12).

Find the number of hours Chef works.

## Input Format

The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers XX and YY — the starting and ending time of working hours respectively.

## Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, the number of hours Chef works.

### Constraints

1≤T≤100

1≤X<Y≤12

### Sample 1:

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Input Samples</th>
    <th>Output Samples</th>
</tr>
<tr></tr>

<tr>
    <td>4<br />1 2<br />3 7<br />9 11<br />2 10</td>
    <td>1<br />4<br />2<br />8<br /><br /></td>
</tr>
</table>


### Explanation:
#### Test case 11: Chef starts working at 11 pm and works till 22 pm. Thus, he works for 11 hour.

#### Test case 22: Chef starts working at 33 pm and works till 77 pm. Thus, he works for 44 hours.

#### Test case 33: Chef starts working at 99 pm and works till 1111 pm. Thus, he works for 22 hours.

#### Test case 44: Chef starts working at 22 pm and works till 1010 pm. Thus, he works for 88 hours.
